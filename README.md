Investigating and Responding to CVE-2024-24919 Exploitation Attempt
What Happened?
An exploitation attempt targeting CVE-2024-24919, a zero-day vulnerability in Check Point Security Gateways, was detected in your network. The attacker executed a Local File Inclusion (LFI) payload through an HTTP POST request, attempting to retrieve the sensitive file /etc/passwd. The exploit pattern was identified and flagged, but the request was unfortunately allowed by the system, suggesting a successful breach.

How It Happened
Exploit Details:

The attacker used the payload aCSHELL/../../../../../../../../../../etc/passwd, a directory traversal exploit, to access system files.

The malicious request was sent to the target URL: 172.16.20.146/clients/MyCRL.

The source of the attack was an external IP address: 203.160.68.12, indicating inbound malicious traffic.

The request was disguised using the User-Agent string: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:126.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/126.0.

Vulnerability Context:

CVE-2024-24919 is a zero-day arbitrary file read vulnerability in Check Point Security Gateways, exploited through LFI tactics.

The security gateway (172.16.20.146) may lack proper patching or mitigation against this vulnerability.

Alert Trigger Reason:

The SOC287 rule detected a known exploitation pattern, indicative of a zero-day LFI attack.

The device action allowed the malicious request, signifying that proper controls (e.g., virtual patching or IPS rules) were not in place.

Steps to Investigate
Validate the Incident:

Confirm the activity as a true positive by reviewing logs and corroborating evidence of file access attempts.

Ensure this was not a planned test or authorized activity.

Impact Analysis:

Check if the /etc/passwd file was accessed or exfiltrated.

Assess whether sensitive accounts or credentials could have been exposed.

Look for signs of lateral movement or privilege escalation attempts.

Threat Actor Analysis:

Investigate the source IP (203.160.68.12) for any known malicious activity or association with Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups.

Use threat intelligence sources to determine the intent and sophistication of the attacker.

Log Review:

Analyze related network and application logs to identify any other suspicious activity involving the attacker’s IP or payload.

Immediate Mitigation Steps
Isolate the Affected Host:

Disconnect the gateway (172.16.20.146) from the network to prevent further exploitation.

Block Malicious Traffic:

Add the source IP (203.160.68.12) to the firewall’s deny list and monitor for any further attempts.

Patch the Vulnerability:

Apply the latest updates or virtual patches from Check Point to address CVE-2024-24919.

Configure your Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) to detect and block exploit attempts.

Enhance Security Controls:

Implement security rules to block directory traversal patterns like ../../.

Ensure sensitive files like /etc/passwd are properly restricted and monitored.

Notify Stakeholders:

Communicate the incident to relevant teams, such as the SOC Tier 2 team, for further escalation.

Alert system owners and stakeholders about the vulnerability and its potential impact.

Long-Term Remediation
Strengthen Monitoring and Detection:

Update SIEM rules to detect similar exploitation patterns in real time.

Implement file integrity monitoring for critical files like /etc/passwd.

Conduct a Security Audit:

Perform a comprehensive review of other Check Point systems for similar vulnerabilities.

Validate patch levels and ensure compliance with security standards.

User Awareness and Training:

Educate internal teams on recognizing and responding to exploitation attempts.

Use this incident as a case study for future phishing or exploitation drills.

Proactive Threat Hunting:

Investigate any other traffic or indicators related to the source IP or exploit payload.

Monitor external threat intelligence feeds for updates on CVE-2024-24919.

Conclusion
The exploitation attempt of CVE-2024-24919 highlights the critical need for timely patch management and proactive defenses. This attack underscores the importance of detecting, isolating, and mitigating threats swiftly to minimize potential damage. Engage Tier 2 for further forensic analysis and implement the recommended actions to safeguard against similar incidents in the future.
